### Overview

The [Social Media Registry](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/verify-social-media.shtml) is an official source of information about social media accounts that represent official U.S. federal government agencies, elected officials, or members of the Presidentâ€™s Cabinet.

If you work for the federal government and have a .gov or .mil e-mail address, you can register official U.S. federal accounts at [DigitalGov.gov](http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/social-media-registry/).

If you have feedback, questions, or want to tell us about the product you built with the Social Media Registry API, please [e-mail us](socialmediaregistry@gsa.gov).

### Get started
We built the API to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find yourself overwhelmed, we organized this site into four major areas.

- [API basics](basics) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [API calls](calls) gives you a hands-on experience of those operations.
- [Example apps](apps) show some of the possible uses for this API.  

### Source Code

The code for the Social Media Registry is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/usagov/ringsail). It is written in Ruby.
