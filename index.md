### Overview

The [Social Media Registry](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/verify-social-media.shtml) is an official source of information about social media accounts that represent official U.S. federal government agencies, elected officials, or members of the Presidentâ€™s Cabinet.

If you work for the federal government and have a .gov or .mil e-mail address, you can register official U.S. federal accounts at [DigitalGov.gov](http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/social-media-registry/).

If you have feedback, questions, or want to tell us about the product you built with the Social Media Registry API, please [e-mail us](socialmediaregistry@gsa.gov).

##### Get started
We built the API to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find yourself overwhelmed, we organized this site into four major areas.

- [API basics](basics.html) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [API calls](console/) gives you a hands-on experience of those operations.
- [Query language](queries.html) contains a comprehensive listing of all the API's types, functions, and enumerations.
- [Field reference](fields.html) lists and describes the type of information available in the registry.
